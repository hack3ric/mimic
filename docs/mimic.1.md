# mimic - eBPF TCP -> UDP obfuscator

## SYNOPSIS

`mimic run` [OPTION...] <interface><br>
`mimic show` [OPTION...] <interface><br>

## OPTIONS

`-?, --help`
: Give this help list

`--usage`
: Give a short usage message

`-V, --version`
: Print program version

### mimic run

`-q, --quiet`
: Output less information

`-v, --verbose`
: Output more information

`-f, --filter=FILTER`
: Specify what packets to process. This may be specified for multiple times. (see [**CONFIGURATION/Filters**](#filters))

`-L, --link-type=TYPE`
: Specify link layer type, can be 'eth' (Ethernet, default) or 'none' (no L2 header, like PPP or TUN)

`-x, --xdp-mode`
: Force XDP attach mode, either skb or native

`-X, --use-libxdp`
: Use libxdp Use libxdp instead of libbpf to load XDP program.
: libxdp supports chaining multiple XDP programs on one interface. Mimic loads libxdp dynamically using dlopen.
: Only available when built with USE_LIBXDP=1.

`-h, --handshake`
: Controls retry behaviour of initiating connection (see [**CONFIGURATION/Handshake and Keepalive Parameters**](#handshake-and-keepalive-parameters))

`-k, --keepalive`
: Controls keepalive mechanism (see [**CONFIGURATION/Handshake and Keepalive Parameters**](#handshake-and-keepalive-parameters))

`-p, --padding`
: Padding size appended to each packet. Pass 'random' to use random padding.

`-W, --max-window`
: Always use maximum window size in TCP packets.

`-F, --file=PATH`
: Load configuration from file

### mimic show

`-c, --connections`
: Show connections

`-p, --process`
: Show process information

## CONFIGURATION

Mimic allows configuration from both command line and configuration file.

### Filters

A filter is an entry of whitelist that looks like a key-value pair: `{origin}={ip}:{port}`. Origin is either **local** or **remote**, indicating which side's IP and port is matched. For example, `remote=192.0.2.1:6000` matches the server's IP (192.0.2.1) and its listening port (6000).

For IPv6, the IP field needs to be surrounded by square brackets: `local=[2001:db8::cafe]:7000`. This means packets originated from or sending to the local machine using that IP and port is processed.

Additionally, settings that overrides global ones can be appended to the back of a filter, such as padding as well as handshake and keepalive parameters (see [**Handshake and Keepalive Parameters**](#handshake-and-keepalive-parameters)):

    local=[fd42:d42:d42:d42::1]:20001,keepalive=60:1:3:1000
    remote=169.254.42.1:11451,handshake=3:3,keepalive=:1::
    local=192.0.2.1:4242,padding=8

### Handshake and Keepalive Parameters

Handshake and keepalive parameters are both specified using unsigned numbers separated by colons (`:`). Duration fields are specified **in seconds**.

Handshake parameters `interval:retry` specifies:

* `interval`: Duration between each handshake (SYN) retry. Defaults to 2. `interval` of 0 makes all connections through this filter passive, i.e. Mimic will not initiate connection on this side.

* `retry`: Maximum retry count before giving up. Defaults to 3. `retry` of 0 means connection resets after first handshake packet does not have response in `interval` seconds.

Keepalive parameters `time:interval:retry:stale` specifies:

* `time`: Duration between last peer activity (i.e. receiving packets) and sending keepalive. Defaults to 180 (3 minutes). `time` of 0 turns off keepalive mechanism. If underlying UDP protocol implements keepalive (e.g. tunnel protocols like WireGuard), it is advised to set this value higher than the protocol's keepalive time.

* `interval`: Duration between keepalive attempt without peer acknowledgement. Defaults to 10. `interval` of 0 disables keepalive and resets immediately after `time` has passed.

* `retry`: Maximum retry count before giving up. Defaults to 3. `retry` of 0 means connection resets after first keepalive packet does not have response in `interval` seconds.

* `stale`: Duration between last underlying activity and reset, disregarding keepalive packets. Defaults to 600 (10 minutes). This is useful when using `remote` filter, and the local port changes due to service restart or connection retry, leaving previous connections captured by Mimic unused.

Numbers can be left out to fall back to default or global respective values:

    handshake=:0     # give up immediately after default interval value and do not retry
    keepalive=60:::  # set keepalive time to 60s only, keeping default values of other fields

### Configuration File

Configuration file passed using the `--file` contains lines of key-value pair in the format of `{key}={value}`. There might be spaces between key, `=` and value. Each pair should be contained in one line:

    # Print more information because we can
    log.verbosity = trace

    # Keep it more alive!
    keepalive = 15:::

    # You only shake hands once
    filter = local=192.0.2.1:6789,handshake=5:0

See **/usr/share/doc/mimic/eth0.conf.example** for detailed examples.

### Available Configuration Keys

`log.verbosity`
: Controls how much information should be printed. Log level equal to or higher (in number) than log verbosity will be discarded. Both number and string matching log levels are accepted. Number must be greater than or equal to 0. Defaults to info (2). Available levels are: 0 - error (cannot be discarded), 1 - warn, 2 - info, 3 - debug, 4 - trace.

`link_type`, `xdp_mode`, `use_libxdp`, `handshake`, `keepalive`, `padding`, `max_window`
: See [**OPTIONS**](#options).

`filter`
: See [**Filters**](#filters). This option may be specified more than once.
